You have the choice to take part in two battles. The cards represent two simulators.
1. The first is a simulator of two teams, which provides the opportunity to see the random movement of objects.
In this simulator, objects are placed randomly on the map.
Several first aid kits and bombs are also placed to intervene in the confrontation.
Objects have health and strength which adds up to represent the object's total stamina.
As a result of two objects from different teams getting into the same position, endurance is compared.
The winner is the team that is the first to destroy the objects of the opposing team.
Object designation: UNIT - ● and ⦿
PANZER - T and Y
JEDI - J and S
CHEST - + and BOMB - o
In the startBattle method of the Beginning1 class in Thread.sleep(400).
400 you can configure the map update delay exactly as you wish.
                
2. The second card is also presented in the form of a card similar to a chessboard, only one color.
Objects are distinguished not by shapes, but by color, located on the battlefield in different parts of the map (similar to the location of chess).
This battle allows the player to control it against the computer.
Near field UNIT objects in the form of ● - have health points (5) and strength points (2), which together give a total stamina (7).
PANZER objects in the form of ▲ - have health points (5) and strength points (4) - which together gives (9).
Jedi objects in the form of □ - have health (5) and strength (6) - which together gives (11).
Objects of the UNIT type have the ability to move in all directions (vertical, horizontal and diagonal) on one cell.
Objects of the PANZER type have the ability to walk (vertically) both on one cell and on two, in other directions only on one.
Objects of the JEDI type have the ability to move (vertically, horizontally) both on one cell and on two, diagonally only on one.
The code is original, written on the idea of creating chess by simplifying moves and changing the logic of the game.
There may be a coincidence between the implementation of the code and the idea of the game Chess.
